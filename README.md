# Quando <//> Local
Local support for Quando

Java based tools to allow Quando to run local access to devices and some platform behaviour.

Note: This will not be useful without Quando.

Currently local support will offer:
* a local server running on port 8080 when the jarfile is executed
* Access to micro:bit and other usb devices from the local machine
* code for devices
* **Experimental** access to mouse and keyboard control (disabled by default)
