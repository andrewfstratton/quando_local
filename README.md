# quando_local
Local support for Quando

Python based tools to allow Quando to run easily on Desktop (and Mobile).

N.B. This depends on Quando and will not be useful otherwise.

Currently local supprot is purely to offer:
* micro:bit access through USB (serial) plugin and running a local server on port 8080 which can be accessed 9to be tested) by the local browser (typically only)
* Other serial/USB connections - e.g. ESP32
* (maybe) local file access for caching
